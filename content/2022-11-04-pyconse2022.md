Yesterday, I hacked together a demo which is based on a real incident at work.
The incident made me realize that 100% code coverage is not good enough and one
has to resort to gradual typing in Python to avoid another class of errors.

Sources to the demo can be found here:

I will add the transcript of the demo soon.
